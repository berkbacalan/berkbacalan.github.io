    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>At <strong>ShopListy</strong>, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>1.1. User-Provided Information:</strong> We collect the information you enter into the app, such as shopping lists, item names, and recipe texts. This data is necessary for the core functionality of the app.</p>
    <p><strong>1.2. Automated Information:</strong> When you use ShopListy, we may automatically collect certain information, including your device type, operating system version, and app usage statistics (via Firebase Analytics).</p>
    <p><strong>1.3. Camera Access:</strong> With your permission, we access your camera solely for the "Handwriting Recognition" feature. Photos taken are processed to extract text and are not stored permanently on our servers unless specifically required for the service.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service.</li>
        <li>To process your lists using <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> for categorization and recipe parsing.</li>
        <li>To analyze app performance and fix bugs (via Firebase Crashlytics).</li>
        <li>To show personalized advertisements to free users (via AdMob or other ad networks).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Processing and AI (Third-Party Providers)</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
        <strong>Important:</strong> To provide AI features (like smart categorization and recipe parsing), certain data (item names and recipe text) is sent to <strong>Google Gemini API</strong>. This data is processed anonymously to provide you with the results. By using these features, you consent to this processing.
    </div>

    <h2>4. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>Free users of ShopListy will see advertisements. These ad providers may use anonymous identifiers from your device to show relevant ads. We also use <strong>Google Firebase</strong> to understand how users interact with the app and to improve user experience.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or mobile storage is 100% secure. <strong>As stated in our Terms, do not store sensitive personal information (passwords, financial data) in ShopListy.</strong></p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>ShopListy does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. You can usually delete your lists directly within the app or contact us for assistance.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
